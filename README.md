### Roach Viewer

A collection of two different displays for simulating a population of cockroaches.

The second class, Roaches,  visualizes the growth of a roach population over a timeframe of 10 generations.  A timer waits
1/2 of a second before either doubling the population or killing a portion of the population.  The simulation lasts 10 seconds.
