### Tanker Truck Calculator

This program was my first attempt in the 2016-17 School Year at creating a standalone application using Java Swing.  This program was the testing
This program takes the estimated lifetime, amount of water drunk per day, and name of a user to return how many 11,000 gallon tanker trucks of water the user will drink in their lifetime.

### World Population

This program This program simulates the population of earth every fifty years
during either a time of peace or during a zombie apocalypse with the user
playing as God.

This interactive console application stores the current world population in millions and then asks the user if it is a zombie apocalpyse or a time of peace.  The population is then changed accordingly.

Steps to run:
1. Download .class file [here](https://github.com/KRagula/Programming-II-Portfolio/blob/master/WorldPopulation/WorldPopulation.class)
2. Open command line and navigate to downloads directory
3. Enter the following command: **java WorldPopulation**

### Flood Map
This class reads terrain values and a water level value and determines which terrain will be above the water or flooded.

A Map is randomly generated with terrain of different altitudes.

The map is then slowly flooded in increments of 10 until it is full.

(The altitudes and displays are from two different runs of the application)

Steps to run:
1. Download .class file [here](https://github.com/KRagula/Programming-II-Portfolio/blob/master/FloodMap/FloodMap.class)
2. Open command line and navigate to downloads directory
3. Enter the following command: **java FloodMap**

Repo [here](https://github.com/KRagula/Programming-II-Portfolio/blob/master/FloodMap)

### Roaches Viewers

A collection of two different displays for simulating a population of cockroaches.

The first class, RoachPopulationViewer, displays an interactive GUI to modify and change the values of the population of
roaches.  It also has an exterminator come every 10 seconds to kill 10% of the population

GUI

The second class, RoachSimulation visualizes the growth of a roach population over a timeframe of 10 generations.  A timer waits
1/2 of a second before either doubling the population or killing a portion of the population.  The simulation lasts 10 seconds.
